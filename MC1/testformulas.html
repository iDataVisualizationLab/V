    In this work, we developed a web application following DualnetView [1] to capture both overall structures and temporal patterns within the graphs.
    The compact force-directed view gives an overview of the graph with communication links aggregated over time. This view provides information about communities and nodes with high centrality.
    On the other hand, the TimeArc [2] view on the right offers temporal communications in the graph that help communicate the dynamics of the underlying network.
    In this view, horizontal orientation represents the timeline, and horizontal lines represent nodes, and edges represent communications.
    The edges are placed at the time the communications happened. The linked supplemental views utilize the strengths of both visualization techniques to provide useful insights into the given graphs.
    This tool is not merely used to report the results. It also offers interactions such as linking, brushing, and filtering to aid users in exploring the results further.

    Besides visual, qualitative analysis, we also adopt graph alignment evaluations to give quantitative, statistical evaluations of the matches between graphs.
    The symmetric graph alignment evaluation symmetric score [3]. Specifically, given two graphs <span lang="latex">G_1 = (V_1, E_1), G_2 = (V_2, E_2)</span>,
    find a mapping function <span lang="latex">f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2</span> to map nodes in the first graph to the second one.
    The induced graph <span lang="latex">\hat G_2 = (\hat V_2, \hat E_2)</span> with nodes <span lang="latex">f(V_1) = \hat V_2 \in V_2</span>, assuming that <span lang="latex"> |V_1| \leq |V_2|</span>,
    and edges are defined as <span lang="latex">\hat E_2 = \{(u, v) | (u, v) \in E_2; u, v \in f(V_1)\}</span>.
    The edges of the first graph mapped into the induced graph are <span lang="latex">f(E_1) = \{(f(u), f(v))\}</span>.
    Finally the alignment score is defined as: <div lang="latex" style="text-align: center;">\frac{|f(E_1)|}{|E_1| + |\hat E_2| - |f(E_1)|}</div>.

    We combined the methods used in questions 1 and 2 to tackle this task.
    First, we already reduce the big graph into more compact and fast-to-access adjacency list representation.
    Second, we already have the algorithm to construct the sub-graphs from initial nodes as in question 2.
    Thirds, to reduce the number of initial seed nodes, we only consider nodes with degrees from 2 up to 100 degrees.
    After having the subgraphs, we will run our visual, qualitative graph mapping tools and the statistical, quantitative graph evaluation formulas to find the best graphs that match the template.

        <h3>1. Life expectancy</h3>
        As shown in Figure 1, the time-series boxplots, and the <i>outlying/inlying</i> streams highlight the 1970s,
        early 1990s, and late 1990s/early 2000s as three periods with high <i>outlying</i> scores. The instance profile
        section shows Cambodia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone as the three items (listed on top of the item profile section
        and having thicker <i>outlying</i> streams) with higher contributions to the overall <i>outlying</i> scores in
        these periods correspondingly. Also, lensing over these periods and clicking on the scatter plots in each of the
        periods show the details scatter plots of these data points in the boxes (a), (b), and (c) of the Figure 1
        correspondingly. Furthermore, mouse over Cambodia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone in these boxes,
        <i>Outliagnostics</i> shows the life expectancy for females and males as low as 27 and 21 in 1975 for Cambodia,
        30 and 26 in 1992 for Rwanda, then 38 and 36 in 1998 for Sierra Leone. These are the consequences of the
        1978-1991 Cambodian Civil War, the 1990-1994 Rwanda Civil War, and the 1991-2002 Sierra Leone Civil War
        correspondingly.

        <h3>2. US Goods and Service Employment</h3>
        Users could also investigate individual data item using the search box. Figure 2 shows
        the case when a user would like to investigate about Louisiana. The user types ``Louisiana'' into the search box
        (a) and clicks search button, the <i>Outliagnostics</i> interface highlights Louisiana in the items profile section and the
        scatterplots time series. The thicker <i>outlying</i> stream for this data item over the June to September
        2005 period suggests user to mouse over this period and the system brings Louisiana to the top of the item
        profile section (b) as it is the main contributor to the <i>outlying</i> scores in this period. The reason for
        this event was the impacts of the hurricane Katrina in Louisiana in August 2005 leading to low numbers of
        employment in both goods-producing and service-providing.

        <h3>3. High Performance Computing Center</h3>
        In this use case, we use <i>Outliagnostics</i> to monitor the healthstatus of a High-Performance Computing
        Center (HPCC) at a university. In particular, the 2 variables being monitored are CPU temperature and fan speed.
        As shown in Figure 3,the thicker <i>outlying</i> stream in the boxplot time series section(a) suggested to the
        users that there might be issues in this period. Also, the Compute 4-17 was placed on top of the item profile
        section (b) with a thicker <i>outlying</i> stream in this period. These suggested the HPCC system administrator
        look into the Compute 4-17 and later found that the fan was broken during that time. With this use in practice,
        we received positive feedback from real users in a real-world application with ease of use and ability to
        quickly spot the potential issues.
